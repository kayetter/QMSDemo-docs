## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 System Description

The `AddRepApi` class is part of a plugin designed to facilitate the management of replication data in laboratory test methods. The plugin operates within the Microsoft Dataverse environment, providing custom business logic for managing method result codes and ensuring accurate data replication.

### 2.2 Assumptions and Dependencies

- The `AddRepApi` class is intended to be used within the Microsoft Dataverse environment.
- The class relies on services and contexts provided by the Microsoft Dataverse platform.
- Proper configuration (both secure and unsecure) is assumed to be provided during initialization.

## 3. Design Specifications

### 3.1 Class: `AddRepApi`

#### 3.1.1 Overview

The `AddRepApi` class is responsible for executing custom business logic related to replication data in laboratory test methods. It includes methods for initialization, execution, and retrieving method result codes.

---

### 3.2 Constructors

#### 3.2.1 `AddRepApi(String unsecureConfiguration, String secureConfiguration)`

**Summary**: Initializes a new instance of the `AddRepApi` class with the specified configuration strings.

**Parameters**:

- `unsecureConfiguration`: The unsecure configuration string.
- `secureConfiguration`: The secure configuration string.

**Design Considerations**:

- The constructor sets up the necessary configuration for the plugin.
- It ensures that both secure and unsecure configurations are appropriately handled.

---

### 3.3 Methods

#### 3.3.1 `ExecuteDataversePlugin(ILocalPluginContext localPluginContext)`

**Summary**: Entry point for custom business logic execution.

**Parameters**:

- `localPluginContext`: The local plugin context.

**Exceptions**:

- `InvalidPluginExecutionException`: Thrown when the `localPluginContext`, `context`, `service`, or `tracingService` is null.

**Design Considerations**:

- The method validates the provided plugin context.
- It executes the main business logic, ensuring that all necessary services are available.

---

#### 3.3.2 `GetMethodResultCodes(Guid methodId, HelperServices.TestService testService)`

**Summary**: Retrieves method result codes for the specified method ID using the test service.

**Parameters**:

- `methodId`: The ID of the method.
- `testService`: The test service.

**Returns**: A collection of method result codes.

**Design Considerations**:

- The method constructs a query to fetch result codes associated with the provided method ID.
- It ensures that only relevant result codes are retrieved, utilizing the test service for efficient data access.

---

#### 3.3.3 `GetReplicatedMethodResultCodes(DataCollection<Entity> methodResultCodeEntities)`

**Summary**: Filters method result codes to include only those that are replicated.

**Parameters**:

- `methodResultCodeEntities`: The collection of method result code entities.

**Returns**: A list of replicated method result code entities.

**Design Considerations**:

- The method processes the provided collection to identify and return only replicated result codes.
- It enhances data management by filtering unnecessary entries.

## 4. Software Design Units

### 4.1 Unit Descriptions

- **Constructor Unit**: Handles the initialization of the `AddRepApi` class.
- **Execution Unit**: Manages the execution of custom business logic within the `ExecuteDataversePlugin` method.
- **Retrieval Unit**: Responsible for retrieving and filtering method result codes through the `GetMethodResultCodes` and `GetReplicatedMethodResultCodes` methods.

### 4.2 Unit Interactions

- The Constructor Unit initializes the class and prepares configurations.
- The Execution Unit utilizes the initialized configurations to execute business logic.
- The Retrieval Unit interacts with the Execution Unit to fetch and filter necessary data.

## 5. Risk Management

### 5.1 Risk Identification

- **Risk**: Null or invalid plugin context during execution.

  - **Mitigation**: Implement thorough validation checks and exception handling in the `ExecuteDataversePlugin` method.

- **Risk**: Incorrect method result codes retrieval.
  - **Mitigation**: Ensure accurate query construction and data validation in the `GetMethodResultCodes` method.

### 5.2 Risk Assessment

- **Severity**: High
- **Probability**: Medium

### 5.3 Risk Control

- Implement unit tests to verify the correctness of each method.
- Conduct code reviews to ensure adherence to best practices and guidelines.

## 6. Verification and Validation

### 6.1 Verification

- Verify that the `AddRepApi` class initializes correctly with given configurations.
- Verify that the `ExecuteDataversePlugin` method executes without errors and handles null contexts appropriately.
- Verify that the `GetMethodResultCodes` and `GetReplicatedMethodResultCodes` methods return accurate and relevant data.

### 6.2 Validation
