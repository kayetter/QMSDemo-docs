# Project Development and Validation Plan

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to develop a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) with features to manage ad hoc subsamples within test forms. The system will adhere to the V-Model development methodology and comply with ISO 13485 and IEC 62304 standards.

## Intended Users

The primary users of the LIMS will be laboratory technicians and administrators. Laboratory technicians will utilize the system to add and manage ad hoc subsamples, while administrators will configure subsample settings and manage overall system operations.

## Process Overview

The development process will follow the V-Model methodology, ensuring that each development phase is accompanied by a corresponding testing phase. The key phases include project planning, requirements gathering, system design, detailed specifications, implementation, and multiple levels of testing. The project aims to deliver a functional LIMS with an intuitive interface for managing subsamples, ensuring compliance with relevant standards.

## Operating Environment

The LIMS will operate in a laboratory environment, supporting Windows and macOS platforms. The system will be accessible via a web-based interface, ensuring ease of use and accessibility from various devices within the laboratory.

## Software Platform

The LIMS will be developed as a Microsoft Power Platform Model-Driven App. This platform allows for rapid development and deployment of custom business applications with rich functionality and integration capabilities. The system will leverage Microsoft Dataverse for data storage and management, providing a secure and scalable environment for laboratory data.

## Sizing/Scalability

The system will be designed to handle a high volume of data, with scalability to support multiple laboratories and an increasing number of users and test records. The architecture will ensure efficient data processing and storage, allowing for seamless expansion as laboratory operations grow.

## Interfaces

The LIMS will feature several key interfaces:

- **User Interface**: A web-based interface for laboratory technicians to manage subsamples and for administrators to configure settings.
- **Admin Interface**: A dedicated interface for configuring subsample settings, including creation and deletion options.
- **API**: Standard APIs for integrating with laboratory equipment and other software systems.
- **Reporting Interface**: Tools for generating and viewing reports on subsample management and test results.
