# Project Plan

## 1. Introduction

This project aims to develop a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) with features to manage ad hoc subsamples within test forms. The project will adhere to the V-Model development methodology and comply with ISO 13485 and IEC 62304 standards.

## 2. Project Objectives

- Develop a system that allows laboratory technicians to add and manage ad hoc subsamples.
- Ensure the system complies with regulatory standards (ISO 13485 and IEC 62304).
- Provide a user-friendly interface for managing subsamples and their associated results.

## 3. Scope

The project scope includes:

- Implementation of ad hoc subsample management features.
- Development of a custom control for the result entry worksheet.
- Creation of an admin interface for configuring subsample settings.
- Ensuring all functionalities meet the specified requirements and acceptance criteria.

## 4. Deliverables

- Functional LIMS with ad hoc subsample management.
- Admin interface for configuring subsample settings.
- Custom control on the result entry worksheet for adding and canceling subsamples.
- Documentation for system configuration and user guides.
